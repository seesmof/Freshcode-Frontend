## Introduction

Like I said above, this is a repository where all of my porjects, related to that course, went. We were doing lots of stuff, looking at a bunch of different technologies in both HTML and CSS. It didn't include JavaScript unfortunately, but that makes senes as it was very beginner friendly. Some of the projects we did was a pizza recipe, a final project with Ukrainian victory festival and some other side stuff.
