    <h2>Important Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <p><em class="date">06.04.2023</em></p>
      <li>
        Elements in a head section are the ones that don't actually appear on
        the page, but they are still important
      </li>
      <li>
        Elements in a body section are the ones that our page will actually
        render
      </li>
      <li>
        Live Server is a useful extension when we have a client-server
        interaction, meaning when we have some JavaScript on our site.
        <em>However</em>, it lags pretty oftenly, so I use this extension,
        called <strong>Live Preview</strong>, much better and opens right in the
        VS Code.
      </li>
      <li>
        In HTML there are also headings, exactly six of them: h1, h2, h3, h4,
        h5, h6
      </li>
      <li>
        Headings are useful not only for the looks, but also for a browser to
        identify the content of our website. That kind of touches on the
        semantic concept that we touched on briefly and will explore in more
        detail later. It all is for the meaning and CSS is for the looks.
      </li>
      <li>
        When we work with an instrument everyday, we unintentionally learn it.
        Exact same thing with any programming language or whatever. We don't
        need to learn each tag there is, we just wanna get familiar with the
        general structure.
      </li>
      <li>
        HTML Periodic Table is a useful table with all the most useful tags and
        their info.
      </li>
      <li>
        A bit more about tags, the most important ones we will memorise pretty
        quickly
      </li>
      <li>
        In tags there are also additional properties. Those are called
        <strong>attributes</strong>. It is a certain information about a
        particular element.
      </li>
      <li title="Attributes are cool!">
        <em>title</em> attribute is a pop-up on hover that outputs some text.
      </li>
      <li>
        Attributes can be global, like <em>title</em>, <em>class</em>, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are also boolean attributes. Those are the ones like
        <em>disabled</em>, they don't need to have a value, so you just add them
        and call it a day.

        <button
          disabled
          style="
            background-color: #212121;
            color: #eee;
            border: 1.5px solid #ccc;
            border-radius: 0.4rem;
            padding: 0.4rem 1rem;
            margin: 1rem 0 0 0;
            text-decoration: line-through;
            display: block;
            font-weight: bold;
          "
        >
          Doesn't work
        </button>
      </li>
      <li>Some of the more popular boolean attributes</li>
      <li>We somehow jumped right onto the forms and input tag, but okay :D</li>
      <li>
        Input tag is a tag that is a prominent part of all forms

        <input
          placeholder="Enter something..."
          type="text"
          style="
            display: block;
            background-color: #212121;
            color: #eee;
            border: 1.5px solid #ccc;
            border-radius: 0.4rem;
            padding: 0.4rem 1rem 0.4rem 0.7rem;
            margin: 1rem 0;
          "
        />
        <div class="test-checkbox-container">
          <input type="checkbox" id="test-checkbox" />
          <label for="test-checkbox">This is a checkbox</label>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>checked</em> attribute works only on checkboxes and radio buttons.
        Means that it is checked by default. Useful for first buttons in a form.
      </li>
      <li>So, gotta look into forms already. Alright!</li>
      <li>
        <em>name</em> attribute for radio buttons associate them with one input
        sort of.
      </li>
      <li>In head element there can be meta tags.</li>
      <li>
        One of the useful and even essential meta tags in a head is charset.
        There we specify our encoding, which is usually UTF-8 or unicode, which
        represents all or almost all the written symbols out there.
      </li>
      <li>HTML tag can and should always take lang attribute.</li>
      <li>Now we're looking at Emmet plugin, pretty cool one.</li>
      <li>Check out aria attributes. Those are for accessibility purposes.</li>
    </ul>
